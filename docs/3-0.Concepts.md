# Concepts

All of the following points are typesafe.

-   [**Entity**](3-1.Entity.md)
    -   Entities are at the heart of `ormgen`.
    -   Entities contains a set of fields.
    -   In database terms, these are your tables.
-   [**EntityField**](3-2.EntityField.md)
    -   In database terms, these are your columns.
-   [**Enum**](3-3.Enum.md) (WIP)
    -   Classic enums.
    -   A lot of databases have support for enums - this is how you define them.
-   [**Mixin**](3-4.Mixin.md) (WIP)
    -   Mixins are a way to reuse fields across multiple entities.
-   [**Generator**](3-5.Generator.md) (WIP)
    -   Generators are the way to generate code from your entities.
    -   There are a couple of built-in generators.
    -   You can also write your own generator.
-   [**Seed**](3-6.Seed.md) (WIP)
    -   Seeds are a way to populate your database with some initial data.
    -   You can define define your seed in pure (typesafe) data, or as a common function.
    -   Each generator will decide how to act on the seed data.
-   [**File tree**](3-7.FileTree.md)
    -   The file tree is the way to organize your entities, enums, mixins and seeds.
