# Concepts

All of the following points are typesafe.

-   [**Entity**](2.ENTITY.md)
    -   Entities are at the heart of `ormgen`.
    -   Entities contains a set of fields.
    -   In database terms, these are your tables.
-   [**EntityField**](3.ENTITY_FIELD.md)
    -   In database terms, these are your columns.
-   [**Enum**](4.ENUM.md) (WIP)
    -   Classic enums.
    -   A lot of databases have support for enums - this is how you define them.
-   [**Mixin**](5.MIXINS.md) (WIP)
    -   Mixins are a way to reuse fields across multiple entities.
-   [**Generator**](6.GENERATOR.md) (WIP)
    -   Generators are the way to generate code from your entities.
    -   There are a couple of built-in generators.
    -   You can also write your own generator.
-   [**Instance**](9.INSTANCE.md) (WIP)
    -   The instance
-   [**Sync**](7.SYNC.md) (WIP)
    -   The sync
-   [**Seed**](8.SEED.md) (WIP)
    -   Seeds are a way to populate your database with some initial data.
    -   You can define define your seed in pure (typesafe) data, or as a common function.
    -   Each generator will decide how to act on the seed data.
-   [**File tree**](10.FLE_TREE.md)
    -   The file tree is the way to organize your entities, enums, mixins and seeds.
