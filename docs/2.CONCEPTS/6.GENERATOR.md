# Generator (WIP)

A generator is a way to generate anything you want from the entities, enums, mixins and meta files.

There are a few built-in generators, but it is also simple to write your own generator, just implement the `OrmGenerator` interace. Read more about this in the [Generators](../3.GENERATORS/) section.
